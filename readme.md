## Ruby on Rails Developer | Focused on Reliability and Maintainable Design

I am a backend-focused **Ruby on Rails developer** dedicated to engineering resilient, production-grade applications. With a Bachelor’s in Information Systems and an ongoing **MBA in Ruby on Rails**, my methodology prioritizes structural integrity and long-term maintainability over mere implementation.

I bridge the gap between complex business requirements and stable code, valuing clear communication, professional ethics, and continuous architectural improvement.
