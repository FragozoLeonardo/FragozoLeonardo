## Ruby on Rails Developer｜Focused on Reliability and Maintainable Design

I am a backend-focused **Ruby on Rails developer** with experience building and maintaining **production-oriented web applications**.  
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and am currently pursuing a specialized **MBA focused on Ruby on Rails** at [MBA on Rails](https://mbaonrails.com.br/).

I place strong emphasis on **code quality, clear architecture, and long-term maintainability**.  
Rather than focusing only on implementation, I aim to understand **business context and requirements** to deliver stable, sustainable solutions.

I value **clear communication, steady improvement, and collaborative teamwork** in development environments.
